project summary:
This circuit is designed to incorporate a variety of components including an Arduino UNO, sensors like the MQ-3 alcohol sensor and MPU-6050
accelerometer/gyroscope, a GPS module (GPS NEO 6M), a GSM module (Sim800l), a motor driver (L298N), and actuators such as a DC motor, buzzer, and LED
The circuit is powered by a Polymer Lithium Ion Battery and a 12v Battery. The Arduino UNO serves as the central microcontroller unit, interfacing with the
sensors, GPS, GSM, and motor driver to perform tasks such as alcohol detection, location tracking, and motor control. The embedded code handles data
acquisition, processing, and communication tasks.
